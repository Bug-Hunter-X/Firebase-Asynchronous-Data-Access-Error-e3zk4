The Firebase SDK may throw an error if you try to access a property of a document snapshot before the snapshot has been fully populated. This can occur if you're trying to access data asynchronously before the asynchronous operation has completed. For example, if you have a function that fetches data from Firebase and then immediately tries to access a field in the snapshot, the field might not yet be available, resulting in an error.
